I am currently a senior studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with a minor in Data Science. I have always loved graphic design and art, and as I grew up I began wanting to learn how to bring those things to life. Whether it be through web, app, or game development, I have grown a passion for learning how to design and develop websites and web applications. I am excited to sharpen these skills and find the chance to apply them to the real world.
